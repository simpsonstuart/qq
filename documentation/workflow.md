## Git Flow  

* [Git Flow Cheat Sheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

**Please remember:** the `development` and `staging` branches still exist as of this writing (3/7/16).
The usage of the development branch is being phased out in favor of the `develop` branch since it corresponds to the GitFlow methodology.
